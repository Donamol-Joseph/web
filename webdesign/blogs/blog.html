        <h2>Introduction to Web Development</h2>
        <p>In this blog post, I explore the exciting world of web development using HTML. Web development is an essential skill in today’s digital world, and learning how to create websites opens up many opportunities.</p>

        <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
        <p>When I first started learning web development, I had no prior experience with coding. I began by learning HTML, the foundational language for creating web pages. HTML provides the structure of a webpage, allowing us to organize text, images, and links.</p>
        <p>Through online tutorials and practice, I began to understand how HTML works and how it interacts with other technologies, like CSS and JavaScript, to build fully functional websites.</p>

        <h3>Tips for Getting Started with HTML</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with the basics: Learn how to structure a webpage with html,head and body tags.</li>
            <li>Understand HTML elements: Learn the meaning and purpose of tags like h1,p,a, and img.</li>
            <li>Use an HTML editor: Tools like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text make coding easier with features like syntax highlighting.</li>
            <li>Practice consistently: The more you code, the better you’ll understand how HTML works.</li>
            <li>Explore resources: Websites like W3Schools and MDN offer free tutorials and references to guide you along the way.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>HTML is the starting point for web development, and mastering it is essential for building websites. As you continue your learning journey, you’ll discover the power of combining HTML with CSS and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites.</p>
        <p>Stay motivated, keep learning, and explore new opportunities in the world of web development!</p>
